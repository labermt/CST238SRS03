The Chaos Game  

Name:  Daniel Lee (Junhyeong)

Notes:  

Create an application that takes multiple user inputs:

Number of iterations. (find a good default) Default = 20

A fraction between [0.0, 1.0]. Default = 0.5

A color. (use a default of your choice) Default = black

The number of vertices. (minimum 3) 6?

How do I go about randomness in java and implement it correctly?

Issues:  

Again time management, finally settled everything about my car accident besides one final thing last week. With that in mind, juggling multiple classes workload that's stacked up has not gone well.

In terms of the program itself, I did understand the concept of what the display output may result in but could not manage to duplicate it for my own program for presentation.
Currently filled with bugs and the display is not working for some reason with the render and slow debugging. Gradle takes a long time to finish compiling.
